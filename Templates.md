# Building Templates
In this section we will explain how to build a template in DNA Center.

## Phylosophies
There are a number of coding paradigms which various programmers use when building, maintaining and publishing programming code which are extremely useful when trying to integrate programmability for use in modern day infrastructure use cases. Lets deal with each concept in turn:

  - imperative in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state
      - procedural which groups instructions into procedures
      - object-oriented which groups instructions together with the part of the state they operate on
  - declarative in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it
      - functional in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications
      - logic in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules
      - mathematical in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem
        
### Modular Programming    
Modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.

A module refers to high-level decomposition of the code of an entire program into pieces: structured programming to the low-level code use of structured control flow, and object-oriented programming to the data use of objects, a kind of data structure.

This calls out two very key points: 

  1. **Functionality**
     Code segmented into small chunks to reduce complexity 
  2. **Reusability**
     Modular code designed for reuse as parts of functions
