# DNAC-TEMPLATES
## Overview
This Repository will give examples of templates used in DNA Center that can be modified. Additional information will be included to hopefully give a well rounded explanation of Automation methods with Templates using DNA Center and flows with both Onboarding and DayN Templates and concepts.

The repository will include scripts and examples with the following:
1. Velocity Scripting
2. Variables
3. Binding Variables
4. Composite Templates

The goal of this repository is a practical guide to allow engineers to rapidly begin using DNAC automation and begin conversion of IOS CLI Templates. The Templates they may have been using over the years and with various use cases and so the intent is to reduce the lift to begin automating.

## Sections
Various sections will be covered within this github repository please use this menu for navigation. Within the various folders are examples, explanation readme files for reference.
